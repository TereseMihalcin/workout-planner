## My Senior final project is an Android Mobile app using Java. It is an workout planner/educational workout app. 
## The following writing describes how this project satisfies Seton Hill's University Learning objectives and how it relates to the courses I have taken.
#
## Learning Objectives:
1.	Independently explore and apply new technologies to facilitate ongoing growth and development in the computer industry.
    - Even though I wouldn’t say Java is a very new technology, android development 	is always changing and It will always be necessary in the app development 	industry.
2.	Solve problems using computing technology.
    - I wanted to create my app specifically because I want people to feel	comfortable exercising in a gym or any public space, especially for those who 	don’t have as much experience with different types of lifting exercises. I felt 	people could use an app to help them plan a workout ahead of time and feel 	comfortable knowing how to correctly complete every exercise.
3.	Develop programs in multiple programming languages, in multiple development environments, and for multiple platforms.
    - I wanted to use Java because I don’t have as much experience with it as I would 	like to. Prior to this project I don’t think I used java much at all since freshman 		year. Additionally, I had no experience with Android Studio before now. I had 	already used XCode and swift for a few of my other projects, so I figured why not 	do the complete opposite of that. Overall, this was a huge challenge for me, but I 	really appreciated the opportunity to work on something I had such little 	experience with, and I think I learned a lot as well. 
#
## Relevant Courses:
1.	Programming 1: Intro to Development
    - This was my first programming course in Java, I Learned all programming basics. Such as variables and conditional statements, which I have many of them implemented in my project.
2.	Programming 2: Mobile App Development
    - This was a mobile app course so this was my first exposure to developing mobile app. We used XCode and Swift In this course to develop IOS Apps. I also learned basic app design and UI best practices in this course.
3.	App Development with Data Structures
    - In this course I learned about many different core data structures. In my project I have implemented many arrays and lists. In this class we also touched on binary trees, stacks and queues.
4. Software Development
   - This course influenced a lot of my project. This class included a group project where we had to design and create an application of our choosing. My group did a web app with a 	mobile version. I mainly worked on the frontend development in this class, while with 	this project I had to learn how to handle the data in the backend.

# Project Plan
- I will admit I feel that I lacked in this area more than I would have liked. I used a website to create a really basic storyboard for my app flow and design. But I used one note a lot to draw small images of what I wanted the pieces to look like, and also to keep a running space for my project notes. Here are some screenshots of my notes in one note in chronological order. I apologize for how disorderly they are, I was not anticipating on turning these in.

## The following are screenshots of my ongoing notes I kept while I progressed through the project.

###### This was thinking process at the beginning of the semester and most of my brainstorming.

###### I wanted to do a web app because that’s what I like it more but this idea just fit better as a mobile app.

###### This was my app flow thinking as well my decision to choose Java over Kotlin.
