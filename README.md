# workout-planner
## My Senior final project is an Android Mobile app using Java. It is an workout planner/educational workout app. 
## The following writing describes how this prject satisfies Seton Hill's University Learning objectives and how it relates to the courses I have taken.
#
# Learning Objectives:
1.	Independently explore and apply new technologies to facilitate ongoing growth and development in the computer industry.
  - Even though I wouldn’t say Java is a very new technology, android development 	is always changing and It will always be necessary in the app development 	industry.
2.	Solve problems using computing technology.
  - I wanted to create my app specifically because I want people to feel	comfortable exercising in a gym or any public space, especially for those who 	don’t have as much experience with different types of lifting exercises. I felt 	people could use an app to help them plan a workout ahead of time and feel 	comfortable knowing how to correctly complete every exercise.
3.	Develop programs in multiple programming languages, in multiple development environments, and for multiple platforms.
  - I wanted to use Java because I don’t have as much experience with it as I would 	like to. Prior to this project I don’t think I used java much at all since freshman 		year. Additionally, I had no experience with Android Studio before now. I had 	already used XCode and swift for a few of my other projects, so I figured why not 	do the complete opposite of that. Overall, this was a huge challenge for me, but I 	really appreciated the opportunity to work on something I had such little 	experience with, and I think I learned a lot as well.
